## 🚀 Features of EduConnect

Because students deserve more than boring PDFs and confused WhatsApp groups.

1. **📅 Personalized Study Plans**  
   Auto-generated study plans, thanks to our API wizardry. No more guesswork—just show up and study (or at least pretend to).

2. **📈 Student Progress Tracker**  
   For students *and* parents. Finally, a way to see if all that "studying" was just binge-watching documentaries on YouTube.

3. **🧠 Interactive Quizzes**  
   Learning disguised as fun. Trick your brain into absorbing knowledge through bite-sized, gamified battles of wits.

4. **📊 Quiz & Test Scorecards**  
   Get the receipts. Know exactly where you stand—and maybe, where you fell.

5. **📚 Content Library**  
   Your one-stop-shop for resources. Think of it as a Hogwarts library, but without the screaming books.

6. **📥 Offline Support**  
   Download content once, study anytime—even in airplane mode or during an apocalypse (provided you charged your device).

7. ** Responsive **
   Student / User can access the web application using devices like laptop and mobile phones.
